# 5G-Network

## ITU(International Telecommunication Union)
It is a United Nations (UN) agency that makes rules and standards for global communication and technology — like the internet, mobile networks (3G, 4G, 5G), and satellites.ITU is important because it keeps global communication organized, fair, and connected — allowing us to call, text, and access the internet anywhere in the world.

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) is divided into three main parts, called sectors — each handling a different area of communication and technology.

</p>


### 1. ITU-R (Radiocommunication Sector)
📡 R = Radio

- Handles all things related to radio waves, satellites, and spectrum.

- Decides how the radio frequency spectrum and satellite orbits are used around the world.

✅ Example: Making sure your mobile signal, GPS, and TV broadcasts don’t interfere with each other.

### 2. ITU-T (Telecommunication Standardization Sector)

📞 T = Telecommunication Standards

* Creates international standards (rules) for communication systems and networks.

* Ensures devices and networks from different countries can work together.
  
✅ Example: Sets standards for internet, fiber optics, 4G, 5G, etc.

### 3. ITU-D (Telecommunication Development Sector)

🌍 D = Development

- Helps developing countries build and improve their communication networks.

- Promotes affordable and equal access to the internet and telecom services.
  
✅ Example: Helping rural or poor areas get access to the internet.

### 2. User Experienced Data Rate (Mbit/s)

→ Average speed a normal user feels.

🔹 4G ≈ 10 Mbps

🔹 5G ≈ 100 Mbps

📈 So downloads and streaming are much faster and smoother.

### 3. Spectrum Efficiency

→ How efficiently the network uses radio frequency.

🔹 5G ≈ 3× better than 4G

🔹 5G ≈ 500 km/h

🚄 Even fast-moving trains or cars can stay connected.

### 5. Latency (ms)

→ Time delay between sending and receiving data.

🔹 4G ≈ 10 ms

🔹 5G ≈ 1 ms

⚡ Very fast response — useful for gaming, self-driving cars, and surgeries.

### 6. Connection Density (devices/km²)

→ How many devices can connect in 1 km² area.

🔹 4G ≈ 10⁵ (1 lakh devices)

🔹 5G ≈ 10⁶ (10 lakh devices)

📱 Perfect for IoT — many sensors and smart devices.

### 7. Network Energy Efficiency

→ How much data can be sent using less energy.

🔹 5G is 100× more energy efficient than 4G.

🌱 Saves power and is eco-friendly.

### 8. Area Traffic Capacity (Mbit/s/m²)

→ Amount of data the network can handle in a given area.

🔹 5G ≈ 10× higher than 4G.

📈 Better performance even in crowded places.

# The 3rd Generation Partnership Project

## 3GPP

It is a global collaboration of telecommunications standards organizations that develops protocols for mobile telephony.Standardize cellular networks so devices and networks can work globally.

## TSG (Technical Specification Group.)

Within 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), TSGs are the top-level groups responsible for creating and maintaining technical standards for mobile communication systems

<p align="center">
  <img width="1280" height="640" src="https://github.com/BhanuPratap0805/5G-Masterclass/blob/089670bf2c6249ad502710140aa45b203f926392/3GPP%20TSG.png">
</p>

3GPP currently has three main TSGs, each focusing on a different technical domain:

| **TSG Name** | **Full Form**            | **Focus Area**                                                                               | **Subgroups (Working Groups - WGs)** |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **TSG RAN**  | Radio Access Network     | All radio-related aspects — from the air interface to base stations (NodeB, eNodeB, gNodeB). | RAN1, RAN2, RAN3, RAN4, RAN5         |
| **TSG SA**   | Service & System Aspects | Overall system architecture, services, management, and security.                             | SA1–SA6                              |
| **TSG CT**   | Core Network & Terminals | Protocols and interfaces for the core network and mobile terminals.                          | CT1–CT6                              |

## Relation between ITU and 3GPP

<p align="center">
  <img width="1280" height="640" src="https://github.com/BhanuPratap0805/5G-Masterclass/blob/0c1c509c96e70ba1d25249f95b5337e25b531a1e/relation.png">
</p>

ITU (International Telecommunication Union) defines the overall requirements and performance targets for 5G under the name IMT-2020.

3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) develops the technical specifications and standards — such as 5G NR and 5G Core — that meet those ITU requirements.

Relation: ITU sets the goals for 5G, and 3GPP creates the detailed technologies to fulfill those goals.

The specifications made by 3GPP are later submitted to ITU, which evaluates and finalizes them as part of the official IMT-2020 (5G) standard.

# 🛰️ 5G Network Architecture

This diagram shows the **basic 5G network architecture** — how your phone connects to the internet through different parts of the 5G system.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1280" height="640" src="https://github.com/BhanuPratap0805/5G-Masterclass/blob/39a8a658b60016ff4337f49ec29dc8a82b1ea8eb/5G%20Use%20Cases.png">
</p>


## 🧩 Main Components

### 1. **UE (User Equipment)**
- Your **smartphone or device** that connects to the 5G network.

### 2. **5G RAN (Radio Access Network)**
- Connects your device to the 5G Core.
- **gNodeB** (Next-generation Node B) acts as the **cell tower/base station**.
- Handles the **wireless connection** between your phone and the network.

### 3. **5G Core**
- The **brain** of the 5G system, managing connections, data flow, and security.
- Key components:
  - **AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function):** Manages registration, connection, and mobility.
  - **SMF (Session Management Function):** Manages data sessions (internet connections).
  - **UPF (User Plane Function):** Routes user data (e.g., video streaming, web browsing).
  - **AUSF (Authentication Server Function):** Verifies user identity (security).
  - **UDM (Unified Data Management):** Stores subscriber information (like SIM data).
  - **PCF (Policy Control Function):** Applies network policies (data limits, priority, etc.).

### 4. **Data Network**
- The **internet** — where all your online content (websites, apps, videos) resides.


## 🔗 Interfaces (Connections)

| Interface | Between | Purpose |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **N1** | UE ↔ AMF (via gNodeB) | Control messages |
| **N2** | gNodeB ↔ AMF | Signaling/control connection |
| **N3** | gNodeB ↔ UPF | User data transfer |
| **N4** | SMF ↔ UPF | Data flow management |


## ⚙️ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. The **UE** (your phone) connects wirelessly to the **gNodeB** (5G cell tower).  
2. The **gNodeB** forwards control messages to the **AMF** and data traffic to the **UPF**.  
3. The **5G Core** functions (AMF, SMF, AUSF, etc.) handle authentication, session setup, and routing.  
4. Finally, the **UPF** sends your data to the **internet** and back to your device.


### 📶 In Simple Terms

> **Your phone → 5G tower → 5G core network → Internet → back to your phone**
