# 5G-Network

## ITU(International Telecommunication Union)
It is a United Nations (UN) agency that makes rules and standards for global communication and technology â€” like the internet, mobile networks (3G, 4G, 5G), and satellites.ITU is important because it keeps global communication organized, fair, and connected â€” allowing us to call, text, and access the internet anywhere in the world.

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) is divided into three main parts, called sectors â€” each handling a different area of communication and technology.

### 1. ITU-R (Radiocommunication Sector)
ðŸ“¡ R = Radio

- Handles all things related to radio waves, satellites, and spectrum.

- Decides how the radio frequency spectrum and satellite orbits are used around the world.

âœ… Example: Making sure your mobile signal, GPS, and TV broadcasts donâ€™t interfere with each other.
