# 5G-Network

## ITU(International Telecommunication Union)
It is a United Nations (UN) agency that makes rules and standards for global communication and technology — like the internet, mobile networks (3G, 4G, 5G), and satellites.ITU is important because it keeps global communication organized, fair, and connected — allowing us to call, text, and access the internet anywhere in the world.

The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) is divided into three main parts, called sectors — each handling a different area of communication and technology.

</p>


### 1. ITU-R (Radiocommunication Sector)
📡 R = Radio

- Handles all things related to radio waves, satellites, and spectrum.

- Decides how the radio frequency spectrum and satellite orbits are used around the world.

✅ Example: Making sure your mobile signal, GPS, and TV broadcasts don’t interfere with each other.

### 2. ITU-T (Telecommunication Standardization Sector)

📞 T = Telecommunication Standards

* Creates international standards (rules) for communication systems and networks.

* Ensures devices and networks from different countries can work together.
  
✅ Example: Sets standards for internet, fiber optics, 4G, 5G, etc.

### 3. ITU-D (Telecommunication Development Sector)

🌍 D = Development

- Helps developing countries build and improve their communication networks.

- Promotes affordable and equal access to the internet and telecom services.
  
✅ Example: Helping rural or poor areas get access to the internet.

## 5G Requirements

It compares 4G (IMT-Advanced) and 5G (IMT-2020) in terms of 8 key features that make 5G much better and faster.
The outer shaded area represents 5G, and the inner one represents 4G.

### 📊 The 8 main features explained:

### 1. Peak Data Rate (Gbit/s)

→ Maximum possible speed.

🔹 4G ≈ 1 Gbps

🔹 5G ≈ 20 Gbps

📈 So 5G is 20 times faster than 4G.

### 2. User Experienced Data Rate (Mbit/s)

→ Average speed a normal user feels.

🔹 4G ≈ 10 Mbps

🔹 5G ≈ 100 Mbps

📈 So downloads and streaming are much faster and smoother.

### 3. Spectrum Efficiency

→ How efficiently the network uses radio frequency.

🔹 5G ≈ 3× better than 4G

📈 Means more data can be sent in the same bandwidth.

### 4. Mobility (km/h)

→ Maximum speed of a moving device that can still stay connected.

🔹 4G ≈ 350 km/h

🔹 5G ≈ 500 km/h

🚄 Even fast-moving trains or cars can stay connected.

### 5. Latency (ms)

→ Time delay between sending and receiving data.

🔹 4G ≈ 10 ms

🔹 5G ≈ 1 ms

⚡ Very fast response — useful for gaming, self-driving cars, and surgeries.

### 6. Connection Density (devices/km²)

→ How many devices can connect in 1 km² area.

🔹 4G ≈ 10⁵ (1 lakh devices)

🔹 5G ≈ 10⁶ (10 lakh devices)

📱 Perfect for IoT — many sensors and smart devices.

### 7. Network Energy Efficiency

→ How much data can be sent using less energy.

🔹 5G is 100× more energy efficient than 4G.

🌱 Saves power and is eco-friendly.

### 8. Area Traffic Capacity (Mbit/s/m²)

→ Amount of data the network can handle in a given area.

🔹 5G ≈ 10× higher than 4G.

📈 Better performance even in crowded places.
